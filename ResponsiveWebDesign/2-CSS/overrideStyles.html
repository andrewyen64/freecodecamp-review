<!-- So we've proven that id declarations override class declarations, 
regardless of where they are declared in your style element CSS.
There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember inline styles? -->
<!-- 
    Also when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important.
    Let's add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color declaration 
    to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink. -->

<!-- body < class < later class < id < in-line style < !important -->
